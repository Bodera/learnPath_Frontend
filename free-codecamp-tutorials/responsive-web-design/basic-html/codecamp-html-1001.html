        <!--To submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML, attach an action to your web form-->
        <form action="/submit-cat-photo">

        <!--Radio buttons are a type of input.-->
        <!--You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.-->
        <!--All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any 
                single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.-->
        <!--By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.-->
        <!--It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element.-->
        <!--You can set a radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.-->

        <!--Checkboxes are another type of input-->
        <!--Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.-->
        <!--Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element.-->
        <!--By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.-->
        <!--All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.-->
        <!--It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding label by setting the
                for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.-->
        <!--You can set a checkbox to be checked by default using the checked attribute.-->
        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Generous

        <!--Input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user. They're also self-closing.-->
        <!--A placeholder does exactly this, displays some text in your <input> element before your user has inputted anything-->
        <!--To make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element.-->
